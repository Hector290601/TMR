\subsection*{Stable branch.}

On this branch\textquotesingle{}ll be all the fancy code to compile and run, so this branch will not be updated with the lasts algorithms, only with the stable ones.

\subsection*{Disclaimer.}

Even this repo has the more stable and fancy scripts, algorithms and codes, these aren\textquotesingle{}t the competition version, so the parameters may change, but i\textquotesingle{}ll try to indicate which parameters you must change and pay special attention.

\subsection*{Hardware Requeriments.}

The hardware where the robot car run, and is designed to run, has a large list of changes, but i\textquotesingle{}ll put here the more actual hardware (stable only, obviously). ~\newline
So, the current list is the next. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Raspberry pi 4 Model B Rev 1.\+4 8\+GB.
\item Roboclaw 2x30A.
\item Servomotor Hexfly 60\+Kg.
\item Redcat Racing Lighting Exp Drift (only the chasis).
\item Personalized 3D printed parts.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Software Requeriments.}

The software requeriments\textquotesingle{}re more complicated to write correctly, because the current OS has a lot of installed packages, currently we haven\textquotesingle{}t a lis from all this packages, configurations or something like that, tat\textquotesingle{}s because I\textquotesingle{}ll write only the main dependences, but you could open a request, discussion or something like that to help me to make more accurate this list. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 22.\+04.\+3 L\+TS
\item Ros2 Iron
\item Open\+Cv 4.\+8.\+1
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Relevant pkgs.}

\subsection*{Robot history.}

Along the project lifecycle, there are many authors, so I\textquotesingle{}ll try to make a timeline alongside all the project, since the main team to the current team. ~\newline
