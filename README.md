# TMR

## Stable branch.
On this branch'll be all the fancy code to compile and run, so this branch will
not be updated with the lasts algorithms, only with the stable ones.

## Disclaimer.
Even this repo has the more stable and fancy scripts, algorithms and codes,
these aren't the competition version, so the parameters may change, but i'll
try to indicate which parameters you must change and pay special attention.

## Hardware Requeriments.
The hardware where the robot car run, and is designed to run, has a large list
of changes, but i'll put here the more actual hardware (stable only,
obviously).  
So, the current list is the next.  
- Raspberry pi 4B 8GB.
- Roboclaw 2x30A.
- Servomotor Hexfly 60Kg.
- Redcat Racing Lighting Exp Drift (only the chasis).
- Personalized 3D printed parts.
