# @brief Main image publisher as /raw_rgb node.
#
# @section detailed_webcam_pub Detail
# This script create the image publisher as "/raw_rgb", open the
# camera, read the camera and publish frames as Ros2 OpenCv messages, to be able
# to all nodes to subscribe to te current frames to process it.
#
# @section parameters_webcam_publisher Important parameters to change.
# On this code, you'll change the camera int ID to select the camera you'll want
# opencv to open, read ad publish on the line:
# ```
# self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
# ```

# @section dependences_webcam_pub Dependences.
# - rclpy
#   - Used to node manipulation.
# - rclpy.node
#   - Used to node manipulation. (really idk why we don't import only this or
# the above library)
# - sensor_msgs.msg.Image
#   - Used to be able to use the Image message type (very self-explained, I
# think)
# - cvBridge.cvBridge
#   - Used to parse cv2 frame (like a numpy's multidimensional array) to ROS2's
# Image type
# - cv2
#   - In this case it's just used to open the camera, grab the image and read
# it from the buffer
